# Brazil's States Game

Based on the [Sporcle's US States Quiz ](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states), but for brazilian states.
This is my first contact with the **pandas** module. I used it to read the csv file with all the states, get the screen (turtle) coordinates so that the name of the state apears in the screen if you guessed it. 
Also, by typing the word *exit* in the input prompt, the game creates a csv file of all the states you forgot, so you can do better next time.
